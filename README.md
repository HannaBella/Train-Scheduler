## Train Scheduler

### This Train Scheduler app calculates when the next train will arrive in relative to the current time.

 The app suits this basic spec(MVP):
  
  * When adding trains, the following data will be submitted to the app
    
    - Train Name 
    
    - Destination 
    
    - First Train Time -- in military time
    
    - Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * Technology used to build this app:
    - HTML5 
    - Bootstrap 
    - jQuery 
    - Firebase database and 
    - Moment.js
