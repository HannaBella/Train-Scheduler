# Train-Scheduler
## Train Scheduler

### This Train Scheduler app calculates when the next train will arrive in relative to the current time.

* To build this app, html, bootstrap, jquery, firebase database and moment Js are used.

 The app suits this basic spec(MVP):
  
  * When adding trains, the following data will be submitted to the app
    
    - Train Name 
    
    - Destination 
    
    - First Train Time -- in military time
    
    - Frequency -- in minutes
